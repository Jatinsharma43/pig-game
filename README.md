# Pig Game

## Description

The Pig Game is a simple two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

## How to Play

- The game is played between two players.
- On your turn, you can roll the die as many times as you want.
- Each roll adds to your current score.
- If you roll a 1, you lose all points accumulated in that turn and your turn ends.
- You can choose to "Hold" your current score, adding it to your total score and ending your turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
